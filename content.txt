Where will my placement be?
Midwifery Placements are allocated across the following trust partners:
Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust
Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust
Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
University Hospitals of Derby & Burton NHS Foundation Trust
... Students will be allocated to “home” and “away” bases during the programme and so will be expected to experience at least two of the above practice organisations. Students will be allocated their “away” base in year one of the programme and their “home” base in years two and three. Allocated placements can be viewed on ARC POW (Student Records System) – placements on the Web

When will I find out my placement?
We aim to release as much information as possible at the start of the academic year. It may not always be possible to release a full year at this stage. Students will know their base for the full year.

Where can I find out the dates for my placement blocks?
Placement blocks are found on the UG academic planner which is found on your BSc Midwifery (all years) Moodle page

My placement is further away than I would like.
We are fortunate to have access to a wide placement circuit which offers a breadth of experiences for our students. Travel time to placements will vary. Where travel times exceed an hour, the school recommends that students seek alternative accommodation near the clinical placement. If you have any concerns, please contact your personal tutor for a discussion and to look at support options such as placement exchange and Placement adjustment process.

Can I find my own placement?
No, you are unable to find your own placements as standard with the exception of the elective placement. All standard placements are arranged by us to ensure they have completed an audit and meet our quality standards. Information about the elective will be presented within your programme module.

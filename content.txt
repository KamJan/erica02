

1. Patient Introduction
Name: Walid Mohammed

Age: 33 (DOB: 29 October 1990)

Background:

IT professional at a city-centre bank (1 year in role).

Moved to the UK 3 years ago with wife and two young children.

History of stress/anxiety linked to job, cultural adjustment, and financial pressures (sole income earner).

2. Symptom Assessment Flow
Chatbot Prompt (Q1):
"Hi Walid. Your GP mentioned low back pain. Can you describe when it started and how it’s affecting you?"

User Input Options (structured):

Onset: 8 months ago.

Location: Lower back (right side), radiating to buttocks and thighs (not below knees).

Pain Type: Dull/stiff (severity: 7/10).

Triggers: Sitting, bending, lifting children.

Impact: Sleep disruption, reduced activity, weight loss (5–6 kg), anxiety about long-term health.

Follow-Up Questions (conditional logic):

"Does the pain include tingling, numbness, or weakness in your legs?"
→ No.

"Have painkillers (e.g., paracetamol) helped?"
→ No relief.

"How has stress affected your pain?"
→ Linked to job demands and fear of worsening symptoms.

3. Medical & Family History
Chatbot Prompts:

"Do you have other health conditions or take medications?"
→ No smoking/drinking. No prior diagnoses.

"Family history of chronic conditions?"
→ Mother: hypertension. Father: high cholesterol. Uncle: severe back issues (limited mobility).

4. Functional Impact Assessment
Chatbot Tools:

Pain Severity Scale: 0–10 rating (back: 7/10, leg: 7/10).

Activity Limitations:

"What activities can’t you do due to pain?"
→ Football, gym, playing with children.

"How does pain affect your work?"
→ Stressful IT role with prolonged sitting.

5. Physical Exam Simulation (AI Adaptation)
(Since chatbots can’t perform physical exams, use descriptive prompts.)

Chatbot Instructions:

"Can you bend forward and describe any pain or stiffness?"
→ "Pain worsens when bending, lasts 2+ hours."

"Try lifting a light object (e.g., a book). Does this trigger pain?"
→ "Yes, similar to lifting my children."

"Rate your discomfort when standing on one leg."
→ Right leg: difficult.

6. Empathetic Reassurance & Next Steps
Chatbot Responses:

"It sounds like this pain is really impacting your daily life. Let’s work on a plan together."

Recommendations:

Stress Management: Referral to mindfulness resources or counselling.

Exercise Modification: Gentle stretching/yoga (avoid aggravating movements).

Clinical Follow-Up: Suggest physiotherapy for mobility training.

Safety Netting: "If you develop leg weakness or numbness, contact your GP urgently."

Why This Works for AI/Chatbot Use
Structured Data Capture: Clear categories (symptoms, history) enable automated triage and documentation.

Conditional Logic: Follow-up questions adapt to user inputs (e.g., radiating pain triggers nerve checks).

Empathy & Clarity: Reassuring tone reduces anxiety, while plain language improves understanding.

Actionable Outputs: Directs users to next steps (exercises, referrals) based on responses.

This format balances clinical rigor with conversational usability, making it ideal for AI-driven healthcare interactions.
